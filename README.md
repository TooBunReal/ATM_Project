# UNIFIED AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION IN MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE

Microservices is an architectural approach that dissects applications into independent services, each handling 
specific functions and communicating via APIs. Core features include functional segmentation, autonomy in deployment, 
API-driven communication, organizational structure based on functionality, lightweight and portable characteristics, 
coupled with autonomous management. While highlighting scalability, ease of maintenance, and reduced complexity, 
this framework encounters challenges in managing interactions, monitoring performance, and ensuring data consistency.
